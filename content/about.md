## Testimonial
> "I worked with Greg in the Ubisoft game lab competition on Blackout. He is one of the best designers I know and an all around great guy. Greg consistently took on extra responsibilities such as level implementation, bug fixing and testing. He was always ready with a helping hand and a sense of humor." `Amelia Payne - Man Down Studio, Microsoft `

> "Greg and I collaborated on Blackout (https://ameliarose.itch.io/blackout),an atmospheric puzzle game set in an arctic research facility. In addition to designing and implementing many of the puzzle mechanics in the game, Greg was charged with communicating specific design parameters to me as I designed our interactive music system. He is a tirelessly hard worker, excellent communicator, and brilliant designer with a broad spectrum of technical chops--I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a talented and team-focused designer." `Cole Swany - Man Down Studio, Respawn Entertainment, Bit Reactor  `
