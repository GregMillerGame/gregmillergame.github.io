CASTLE BREEN (HALF-LIFE 2)

Completed on December 9th, 2019

Created using Valve's Hammer Editor, this two-part level was created as part of a class studying level design. Starting off stripping the player of all their weapons, the player must escape a Combine occupied Castle. This study into level design was the final project out of a series of tests, and focuses on the pacing of the experience, giving the player intense combat experiences, and a daring escape at the end. This new experience was created only using base Half-Life 2 assets and logic, used in a new context to create new types of situations.
